# MagicPods-Windows
Add little magic to your Airpods

# How it's work?
1. Turn on bluetooth.
2. Check your AirPods name. It must contaion word `airpods`. Example "Jhon AirPods".
3. Bring the Airpods to the computer and open them.
4. Watch magic.

# Still does not work?
1. Check your bluetooth. It must be 4.0 or above version.
2. Turn on startup. If you skip this step or disable startup, go to Task Manager and turn on `MagicPods Servive`.
3. Turn on bluetooth and reboot your system.
4. Go to `How it's work?`

If it does not help. Contact with me by email and attach the file MagicPodsServiveLog.txt or open Issues here.
